# Weather AppÂ JS

This repository contains a basic weather application that fetches current weather data for a city using a public API.  The app uses `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous requests and updates the DOM with temperature, conditions, and icons.  Users can search for a location, view the results, and toggle between metric and imperial units.  Creating this app reinforced my understanding of `fetch`, promises, and user interface updates.  To test it, open `index.html` and enter a city name.
